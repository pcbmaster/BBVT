BBVT
========

Why?
--------
I have a few Blackberry 957s sitting around and I figured I could put them to good use.  There exists a serial terminal application for the 957 (which this project is based off of), but it only displays raw input, displaying escape codes as well.  This was not useful for my intended application, so I decided to modify BBterm to support VT100 escape codes.

Usage
---------
